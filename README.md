This is a prototype for the propensity score. 

app.py and model.py utilize fhir synthea patient dataset (needs work)

app2.py and modelcsv.py utilize csv synthea patient dataset (works better but is limited to diagnosis [not that many in the patient dataset])

Deployable link (uses app2.py): https://propensity-score.streamlit.app/

make sure to give the app time to load the model (about 30 seconds)

to deploy the link via streamlit i had to use my personal github accound because it cant find school associated repos. Here is the repo on the personal if needed. it has some updated logic
